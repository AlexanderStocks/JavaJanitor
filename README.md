# JavaJanitor

In large codebases there are often lots of incremental improvements and refactorings that could be made to the code to improve it, if only anyone could find the time to get around to it.
This project aims to create an automated refactoring janitor that would continuously analyse a codebase, detect areas of low code quality, and propose PRs to incrementally improve the code.
